Fosstats
========

A simple site that aggregates data from sites like GitHub, BitBucket and others so we can bring attention to under
appreciated FOSS projects.

Current goal
------------

Make a small website dedicated to scraping github (and other) data under several heuristics and have an API that
others like Gittip.com could then use.


Please contribute!
------------------

Anyone is welcome to help out, brainstorm, submit ideas, code, time, resources etc. Please help! :)

Note: this idea started from a conversation over in https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/881#issuecomment-24377505.
